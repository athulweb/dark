    <h1>About Tool</h1>
        SBX is a custom-built penetration testing tool designed to execute the Server Killer Theory ‚Äî a full-force overload framework that simulates request storms to test a server‚Äôs ability to withstand connection pressure, logic loop overflows, and backend dropouts.

    It doesn‚Äôt sneak in.
    It kicks the door, storms the hallway, and sees which wall falls first.

    <h1>About - Idea</h1>

 <div class="dialogue">
    üé≠ This tool is created by the theory 
    <span class="role"> <strong>Server killer theory</strong></span> <br>
    The theory is founded by Athul vinod.<br>

<h1>Server Killer theory </h1>
<span class="role">‚ÄúEvery server has a breaking point ‚Äî SBX finds it, tests it, and exposes the weak undercode.‚Äù
</span>

Every website lives on a fragile thread of connections between frontend visuals and backend logic. If an attacker floods the server with excessive requests, this thread snaps ‚Äî the backend becomes paralyzed, the database hides, and the frontend collapses into a cold, static shell.

This simulation, known as Application Layer DoS, doesn‚Äôt destroy data ‚Äî it breaks the conversation between site and server, making the site look online, but act dead.
This is Server killer theory Founded by Athul vinod
